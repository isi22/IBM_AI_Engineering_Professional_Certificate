## Projects

### Course 1: Machine Learning with Python
#### [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb) _[(open with nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)_

This analysis constructs binary classification models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using Python and libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. It involves data cleaning and feature engineering, and compares the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.  

### Course 3: Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow
#### [Waste Classification](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Waste_Classification.ipynb) _[(open with nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Waste_Classification.ipynb)_

This analysis constructs a binary classification model to categorise waste products as 'Organic' or 'Recyclable', using Python and libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. It employs transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model, and involves image data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation of model performance. 

### Course 6: AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
#### [Crack Detection](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Crack_Detection.ipynb) _[(open with nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Crack_Detection.ipynb)_

A crack detection system is developed using a binary classification approach. The methodology involves leveraging Python and the PyTorch framework, with transfer learning implemented via a pre-trained ResNet model. Image augmentation techniques are applied, followed by model training and evaluation of its crack detection capabilities.
