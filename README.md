### [Course 1: Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)
This analysis constructs binary classification models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using Python and libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. It involves data cleaning and feature engineering, and compares the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
