Case studies and projects completed as part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera

## Projects

### Course 1: Machine Learning with Python
#### [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb) _[(open with nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb)_

This analysis constructs binary classification models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using Python and libraries like scikit-learn and pandas. It involves data cleaning and feature engineering, and compares the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.  

### Course 3: Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow
#### [Waste Classification](https://github.com/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Waste_Classification.ipynb) _[(open with nbviewer)](https://nbviewer.org/github/isi22/IBM_AI_Engineering_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/Waste_Classification.ipynb)_

This analysis constructs a binary classification model to categorise waste products as 'Organic' or 'Recyclable', using Python and libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. It employs transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model, and involves image data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and evaluation of model performance.
